                    <h2>Climate</h2>
                    <p> 
                        Our world is changing faster than anyone predicted. Already, freshwater supplies are shrinking, agricultural yields are dropping, our forests are burning, and rising oceans are more acidic—all, in part, due to a warming climate. As our natural world changes around us, so does our way of life. Coastal home values drop as insurance premiums rise; drought reduces feed for American farmers’ cattle and water for their crops; more pollen and dust in the air aggravates asthma and allergies in kids and adults alike.
                        At WWF, we believe we can fight this consequential threat and build a safer, healthier and more resilient future for people and nature. We must rethink the way we produce and consume energy, food, and water; protect the world's forests; and help people prepare for a changing world.

                    <h2>Species</h2>
                    <p>
                    We protect wildlife because they inspire us. But we also focus our efforts on those species—like tigers, rhinos, whales and marine turtles—whose protection influences and supports the survival of other species or offers the opportunity to protect whole landscapes or marine areas.

                    <p>
                    From the Arctic to the Eastern Himalayas, WWF works on every continent to halt and reverse declines in wildlife numbers and the unsustainable use of our natural resources. By working with partners on local and global levels, and supporting inclusive area-based conservation efforts, WWF aims to conserve many of the world’s most ecologically important regions.
