       <h1>What is the WWF?</h1>

       <h1>More about the WWF</h1>
       <p>"World Wildlife Fund works in nearly 100 countries to tackle the most pressing issues at the intersection of nature, people, and climate."
       WWF works to help local communities conserve the natural resources they depend upon; transform markets and policies toward sustainability; and protect and restore species and their habitats. Our efforts ensure that the value of nature is reflected in decision-making from a local to a global scale.
       WWF connects cutting-edge conservation science with the collective power of our partners in the field, more than 1.3 million supporters in the United States and 5 million globally, and our partnerships with communities, companies, and governments.
       Today, human activities put more pressure on nature than ever before, but it’s also humans who have the power to change this trajectory. Together, we can address the greatest threats to life on this planet and protect the natural resources that sustain and inspire us.

    <h1>Sections The WWF Deals with </h1>
    <article class="browser">
    <h2>Climate</h2>
    <p> 
      Our world is changing faster than anyone predicted. Already, freshwater supplies are shrinking, agricultural yields are dropping, our forests are burning, and rising oceans are more acidic—all, in part, due to a warming climate. As our natural world changes around us, so does our way of life. Coastal home values drop as insurance premiums rise; drought reduces feed for American farmers’ cattle and water for their crops; more pollen and dust in the air aggravates asthma and allergies in kids and adults alike.
    At WWF, we believe we can fight this consequential threat and build a safer, healthier and more resilient future for people and nature. We must rethink the way we produce and consume energy, food, and water; protect the world's forests; and help people prepare for a changing world.

    <h2>Species</h2>
    <p>
    We protect wildlife because they inspire us. But we also focus our efforts on those species—like tigers, rhinos, whales and marine turtles—whose protection influences and supports the survival of other species or offers the opportunity to protect whole landscapes or marine areas.
    </p>

    <h2>The Environemnt</h2> 
    <p>
    From the Arctic to the Eastern Himalayas, WWF works on every continent to halt and reverse declines in wildlife numbers and the unsustainable use of our natural resources. By working with partners on local and global levels, and supporting inclusive area-based conservation efforts, WWF aims to conserve many of the worlds most ecologically important regions.
